I am a Senior Member of IEEE, and I received my M.Sc. degree in 2009 and my Ph.D. degree in 2014.
Between 2014 and 2021, I was an Assistant Professor at the University of Udine. I was also a Postdoctoral Researcher at Aalborg University, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Since 2015, I have been part of the organising committee of the
[IEEE VR Workshop on Sonic Interactions for Virtual Environments (SIVE)](https://sive.create.aau.dk/) (chair of the 2018, 2020, and 2022 editions). I am currently an Associate Professor at the University of Padova, Padua, Italy, and I am also part of the coordination unit of the [EU-H2020 project SONICOM](https://www.sonicom.eu/principal-investigator/michele-geronazzo/) at Imperial College London. My research interests mainly include modeling and simulation of complex human-machine sonic interactions. I am also an
Associate Editor for:

- [IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/ieee-open-journal-signal-processing/about-open-journal-signal-processing)
- [ACM Transactions on Applied Perception](http://tap.acm.org/)
- Springer's journal [Multimedia Tools and Applications](https://link.springer.com/journal/11042)

I am also Editor of the [Springer-Nature's Book Sonic Interactions in Virtual Environments](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-04021-4).

I was the co-recipient of six best paper/poster awards and co-author of more than 100 scientific publications.
