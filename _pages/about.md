I am an Associate Professor of Computer Engineering (SSD ING-INF/05) at the University of Padua, Department
of Management and Engineering. My research focuses on modeling and simulation for immersive multimodal
virtual and augmented reality, with an emphasis on acoustic and auditory information and their integration
with other sensory data.

I hold the Italian National Scientific Habilitation as Full Professor in Computer Engineering (2023) and
previously received habilitation as Associate Professor in Computer Science (2021). I have authored 100+
publications across journals, books, and international conferences, and I have led or coordinated national
and international research projects in immersive audio and virtual environments.
